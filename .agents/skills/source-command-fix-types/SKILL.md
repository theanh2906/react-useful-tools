# source-command-fix-types

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `fix-types`.

## Command Template

Run `bun run typecheck` or `tsc` or `npx tsc` and fix all type errors.

## Rules
- Fix all of type errors and repeat the process until there are no more type errors.
- Do not use `any` just to pass the type check.
